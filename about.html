    <p class="bio">This is a website just for me. It is about me and for me. You have come to this website to learn about me. Interesting..... What would you like to know? I could tell you all about my successes but it would take only three seconds. I can tell you about my One Direction fandom phase because that would take a long time and is funny. </p>
    
    <p class="boss">I work for Sony Music and I am really funny and make up a lot of original content. I also have seen Boss Baby 3 times and I think it deserved an Oscar for Best Animation? </p>
    
    <p class="lastp">But on the real. I am a 20 year old lady living in New Orleans trying to find myself and what I want to do for my life! I work on art and have a side project called Great Fruit, an art collective I started with my best friend. It drops last of March, please keep a look out at @bygreatfruit on Instagram.</p>
